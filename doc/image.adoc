[[image]]
=== Image

An <<image, _image_>> object encapsulates information about an image or texture,
with the sole purpose to pass it across the Nuklear API and back to the application.
It may cointain either a texture id (integer) or a lightuserdata with image
information opaque to Nuklear. It may also represent a portion of an image (i.e. a 'subimage').

* _image_ = *new_image*(_id|ptr_) +
_image_ = *new_subimage*(_id|ptr_, _w_, _h_, <<rect, _subregion_>>) +
_image_++:++*free*( ) +
[small]#_id_, _w_, _h_: integer, +
_ptr_: lightuserdata containing image information opaque to Nuklear. +
Rfr: nk_image.#

[[image_info]]
* _id|ptr_ = _image_++:++*info*( ) +
_id|ptr_, _w_, _h_, <<rect, _subregion_>> = _image_++:++*info*( ) +
[small]#_w_, _h_ and _subregion_ are returned only if _image_ is a subimage.#
