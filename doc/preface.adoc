== Preface

This is the reference manual of *MoonNuklear*, which is a 
http://www.lua.org[*Lua*] binding library for the 
https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/nuklear[*Nuklear*] immediate mode GUI toolkit.
footnote:[
This manual is written in
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc], rendered with
http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] and a CSS from the
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory[AsciiDoctor Stylesheet Factory].]

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with both Nuklear and the Lua programming language.

For convenience of reference, this document contains external (deep) links to the 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html[Lua Reference Manual] and the 
https://immediate-mode-ui.github.io/Nuklear/doc/index.html[Nuklear documentation].

=== Getting and installing

For installation intructions, refer to the README file in the 
https://github.com/stetre/moonnuklear[*MoonNuklear official repository*]
on GitHub.

=== Module organization

The MoonNuklear module is loaded using Lua's 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-require[require]() and
returns a table containing the functions it provides 
(as usual with Lua modules). This manual assumes that such
table is named *nk*, i.e. that it is loaded with:

[source,lua,indent=1]
----
nk = require("moonnuklear")
----

but nothing forbids the use of a different name.

=== Examples

Complete examples can be found in the *examples/* directory of the release package.
